4, 5, 6, 7 are all perfect models
training is inconsistent - so far current parameters are best I could find so far
sometimes model is perfect, sometimes its very poor => lots of local minima and potential randomness
one of the most important (and hard to realize) things is that you need exploration to always happen to actually explore the entire space
